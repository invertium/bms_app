# ⚡ BMS Dash

A modern Android dashboard for **JBD / Xiaoxiang smart BMS** (battery
management systems) over Bluetooth LE — state of charge, per-cell voltages,
live graphs, alerts, and MOSFET control in a dark, glanceable UI.

Free for personal use. If it saves your pack, consider

## Features

- **Dashboard** — radial SOC gauge, pack voltage/current/capacity/temperature
  tiles, decoded protection warnings, session charge/discharge energy
  (Ah / Wh), device info (hardware/software version, production date,
  cycles), and a single hardened toggle for the charge + discharge MOSFETs
  (confirm-and-retry against telemetry, confirmation prompt before cutting
  power).
- **Cells** — one bar per cell with relative zoom so a 20 mV drift is
  obvious, min/max/delta/average stats, and live balancing indicators.
- **Monitor** — smooth gradient time-series graphs for voltage, current,
  power, SOC, and temperature with 1 m / 5 m / 15 m / All windows and touch
  tooltips.
- **Alerts** — optional thresholds for low/high SOC, cell imbalance, and
  temperature; a banner appears on the dashboard while a condition holds.
- **Settings** — °C/°F, cell voltages in V or mV, poll rate, graph history
  window (30 min – 4 h), a custom pack name, and keep-screen-awake. All
  persisted on-device.
- **Connectivity** — BMS-first device filtering, auto-reconnect to the last
  pack on launch, and a stale-data watchdog that tears the session down
  instead of showing frozen values.
- **Demo mode** — a built-in simulated 10S pack, so you can explore every
  screen without hardware (it drives the exact same code paths).

Tested against a JBD **SP17S005P17S80A** (10S LiFePO₄/Li-ion configurations).
Any BMS speaking the JBD/Xiaoxiang UART-over-BLE protocol (GATT service
`0xFF00`) should work.

## Getting it

- **Google Play** — coming soon (in testing).
- **GitHub releases** — signed APKs on the
  [releases page](https://github.com/invertium/bms_app/releases).
- **Build it yourself** — see [Building](#building) below.

## Safety

The app is read-mostly by design: the **only** write it ever sends is the
volatile MOSFET on/off command (register `0xE1`). It never enters factory
mode and never touches EEPROM/protection settings, and the BMS's hardware
protections stay active regardless of what the app does. Still: this
software comes **without any warranty** (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)) — you are
working with hardware that manages a battery; keep the pack's limits in
mind.

## Privacy

BMS Dash collects nothing. It has no `INTERNET` permission, so it cannot
phone home even in principle; Bluetooth is used only to talk to your BMS,
and settings stay on your device. Details in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Building

Everything runs in Docker — no local Flutter/Android SDK needed, only
`docker` (with the compose plugin) and `adb` on the host:

```sh
make deps      # flutter pub get
make analyze   # static analysis
make test      # unit + widget tests
make apk       # debug APK -> build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

Install on a USB-connected phone with `make install-debug`, or use the
containerized Android emulator (`make emulator`, then
`adb connect localhost:5555`) together with demo mode — the emulator has no
Bluetooth, demo mode covers that. See
[docs/host-tools.md](docs/host-tools.md) for host-side adb notes.

### Release builds

Release builds are signed with the keystore referenced by
`android/key.properties` (not in version control); without it they fall back
to the debug key so the project still builds from a fresh clone:

```sh
docker compose run --rm flutter flutter build apk --release
```

## How the code is organized

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/jbd_bms.dart` | JBD frame codec + BLE session (polling, watchdog, MOSFET confirm-and-retry) |
| `lib/demo_bms.dart` | Simulated 10S pack implementing the same session interface |
| `lib/ble.dart` | Scanner/connection abstraction over `flutter_blue_plus` |
| `lib/bms_state.dart` | Riverpod state: telemetry history, session energy, alerts, reconnect |
| `lib/settings.dart` | Persisted settings + alert threshold evaluation |
| `lib/screens/` | Connect, dashboard, cells, monitor, and settings screens |
| `lib/theme.dart`, `lib/widgets.dart` | Dark navy + pink/purple design system |
| `test/` | Protocol golden frames, settings/alert/energy logic, widget smoke test |

### Protocol

The JBD frame codec lives in [`lib/jbd_bms.dart`](lib/jbd_bms.dart) with
golden-frame tests in [`test/jbd_bms_test.dart`](test/jbd_bms_test.dart):
basic info (`0x03`), cell voltages (`0x04`), hardware version (`0x05`), and
MOSFET control (`0xE1`), including balance bits, protection-status decoding,
and the software-FET-lock quirk (bit 12 is set by the off command and is not
a fault).

redistribution (including re-uploading to app stores) are not permitted —
official builds come only from this repository's releases and the official
store listing. Version 1.0.0 was released under MIT and stays MIT.
