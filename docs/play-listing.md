BMS Dash turns your phone into a live dashboard for JBD / Xiaoxiang smart
battery management systems over Bluetooth LE — the BMS boards used in many
DIY powerwalls, e-bikes, campers, and solar storage packs.

DASHBOARD
• State of charge at a glance on a radial gauge
• Pack voltage, current, remaining capacity, and temperatures
• Charged and discharged energy for the current session (Ah and Wh)
• Decoded protection warnings the moment the BMS raises them
• One hardened switch for the charge/discharge MOSFETs, with a
  confirmation prompt and command verification

CELLS
• Every cell voltage, live, with bars zoomed to the pack's min–max range
  so even a 20 mV drift is instantly visible
• Lowest / highest / delta / average, plus balancing indicators

MONITOR
• Smooth graphs of voltage, current, power, SOC, and temperature
• 1 minute to multi-hour history windows with touch tooltips

ALERTS
• Optional thresholds for low/high SOC, cell imbalance, and temperature
• A clear banner on the dashboard while a condition holds

MADE FOR YOUR PACK
• °C or °F, cell voltages in V or mV, custom pack name
• Adjustable poll rate and graph history window
• Keep-screen-awake option for bench monitoring
• Auto-reconnects to your last pack on launch
• Demo mode: explore the whole app with a simulated pack — no hardware
  needed

SAFE BY DESIGN
The app is read-mostly: the only command it ever writes is the volatile
MOSFET on/off switch. It never touches factory mode, EEPROM, or protection
settings, so your BMS configuration cannot be changed — or damaged — from
this app.

PRIVATE BY DESIGN
No accounts, no ads, no analytics. The app does not even request internet
access; your battery data never leaves your phone.

Works with BMS boards speaking the JBD / Xiaoxiang UART-over-BLE protocol
(GATT service 0xFF00), such as the JBD SP-series. Tested against a JBD
SP17S005 on a 10S pack.

BMS Dash is free. If it saves your pack, you can buy the developer a
coffee from the About screen.

## Release notes for the first upload (500 chars max)

```
First Play release of BMS Dash: live SOC/voltage/current dashboard,
per-cell voltages with drift zoom, telemetry graphs, alert thresholds,
session energy stats, MOSFET control with confirmation, °C/°F and V/mV
units, and a demo mode that works without hardware.
